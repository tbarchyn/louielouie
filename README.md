## louie louie

Once the subject of an FBI investigation, the lyrics of this rock 'n' roll classic have long been confusing. Confront your confusion with this handy script. Includes random intervals between lyrics! Not just random, but random intervals pulled from a Weibull distribution.


### Getting started
Relive the glory for the first (!) time.
```
python louielouie.py
```

### Getting deeper
Relive the glory in more depth.
```
python louielouie.py
```

### Parallization
Relive the glory in parallel! Whoa!? The Kingsmen ('America's greatest party band') didn't ever play this song in parallel you say . . well, thanks to the computer and this ultramodern multiparadigmatic programming idiom, you can now experience louie louie in parallel!

Heck, you can even race your different versions - the random intervals will make this race totally unpredictable and a nail biter right to the end.
```
python louielouie.py

// open an new shell next to the first one
python louielouie.py

// open another new shell next to the first two
python louielouie.py

// etc . . . 
```
